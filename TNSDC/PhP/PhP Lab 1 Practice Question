Create a PHP program that calculates the grade classification based on a student's percentage score. The program should take the percentage as input and use the following criteria:

If the percentage is greater than or equal to 90, the grade is 'A'.
If the percentage is between 80 and 89, the grade is 'B'.
If the percentage is between 70 and 79, the grade is 'C'.
If the percentage is between 60 and 69, the grade is 'D'.
If the percentage is below 60, the grade is 'F'.

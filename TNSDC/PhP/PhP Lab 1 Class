Write a PHP program that takes an integer as input and determines whether it is an odd or even number. The program should then print a message indicating whether the input number is odd or even

<?php
// Taking input from the user
$number = readline("Enter an integer: ");

// Checking if the number is odd or even
if ($number % 2 == 0) {
    echo "$number is an even number.\n";
} else {
    echo "$number is an odd number.\n";
}
?>

Create a PHP program that models a Book class. The class should have attributes such as title, author, and price. Implement a method to calculate the total cost of a given quantity of books. Create instances of the Book class, and calculate and display the total cost for each book, considering a quantity of 5 for each book.

<?php
class Employee {
    // Attributes
    private $id;
    private $name;
    private $designation;
    private $salary;

    // Constructor
    public function __construct($id, $name, $designation, $salary) {
        $this->id = $id;
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->designation = $designation;
        $this->salary = $salary;
    }

    // Method to display employee information
    public function displayInfo() {
        echo "Employee ID: $this->id\n";
        echo "Name: $this->name\n";
        echo "Designation: $this->designation\n";
        echo "Salary: $this->salary\n\n";
    }
}

// Creating instances of Employee
$employee1 = new Employee(1, "John Doe", "Software Engineer", 60000);
$employee2 = new Employee(2, "Jane Smith", "UX Designer", 55000);
$employee3 = new Employee(3, "Bob Johnson", "Project Manager", 75000);

// Displaying information for each employee
$employee1->displayInfo();
$employee2->displayInfo();
$employee3->displayInfo();
?>

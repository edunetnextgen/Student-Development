Write a simple Python program to determine the cost of admission to a zoo based on the age of a visitor. Prompt the user to enter their age, and then display the admission cost in Indian Rupees (INR) according to the following criteria:

Children (age 0-5): Free
Kids (age 6-12): ₹50
Teenagers and Adults (age 13-59): ₹100
Seniors (age 60 and above): ₹70

age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age < 0:
    print("Invalid age. Please enter a valid age.")
elif age <= 5:
    print("The admission is free for children (age 0-5).")
elif 6 >= age <= 12:
    print("The admission cost for kids (age 6-12) is ₹50.")
elif 13 >= age <= 59:
    print("The admission cost for teenagers and adults (age 13-59) is ₹100.")
elif age >= 60:
    print("The admission cost for seniors (age 60 and above) is ₹70.")
else:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer for age.")

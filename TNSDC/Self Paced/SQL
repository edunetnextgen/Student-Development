Create a MySQL database "SchoolDB" with a "Student" table, including columns for student_id, first_name, last_name, age, and grade. Perform CRUD operations

-- Create a new database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS SchoolDB;

-- Switch to the new database
USE SchoolDB;

-- Create a student table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Student (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    age INT,
    grade VARCHAR(10)
);

-- Insert a new student
INSERT INTO Student (first_name, last_name, age, grade) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 15, '10th');

-- Insert another student
INSERT INTO Student (first_name, last_name, age, grade) VALUES ('Jane', 'Smith', 16, '11th');


-- Select all students

-- Select students in a specific grade
SELECT * FROM Student WHERE grade = '10th';

-- Select a specific student by ID
SELECT * FROM Student WHERE student_id = 1;

-- Update the grade of a student

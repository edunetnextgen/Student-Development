Write a PHP program that takes the bill amount as input and calculates the discount based on the following rules:

If the bill amount is between ₹1000 and ₹4999 (inclusive), apply a 10% discount.
If the bill amount is ₹5000 or more, apply a 20% discount.
Display the original bill amount, the calculated discount, and the final amount after applying the discount.

<?php
    // Function to calculate discount based on bill amount
    function calculateDiscount($billAmount) {
        $discount = 0;

        if ($billAmount >= 1000 && $billAmount <= 4999) {
            // Apply 10% discount for bill amount between ₹1000 and ₹4999
            $discount = 0.1 * $billAmount;
        } elseif ($billAmount >= 5000) {
            // Apply 20% discount for bill amount ₹5000 and above
            $discount = 0.2 * $billAmount;
        }

        return $discount;
    }

    // Example usage:
    $billAmount1 = 3000;
    $discount1 = calculateDiscount($billAmount1);

    if ($discount1 > 0) {
        echo "Original Bill Amount: ₹$billAmount1\n";
        echo "Discount: ₹$discount1\n";
        echo "Final Amount after Discount: ₹" . ($billAmount1 - $discount1) . "\n";
    } else {
        echo "Original Bill Amount: ₹$billAmount1\n";
        echo "No discount applicable for the given bill amount.\n";
    }
?>

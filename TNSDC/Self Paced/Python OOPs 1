Create a Python program that defines a Book class with a constructor (__init__) to initialize the title, author, and publication year attributes. The class should also include a display_info method to print detailed information about the book.

class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, publication_year):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.publication_year = publication_year

    def display_info(self):
        print("Book Information:")
        print(f"Title: \"{self.title}\"")
        print(f"Author: {self.author}")
        print(f"Publication Year: {self.publication_year}")

book1 = Book("The Catcher in the Rye", "J.D. Salinger", 1951)
book1.display_info()
